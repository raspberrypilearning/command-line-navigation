Here is a summary of the basic commands you can use to navigate the command line:

`ls` lists directory contents
```bash
ls
```

`pwd` "print working directory" tells you what directory you are currently in.
```bash
pwd
```

`cd` "change directory" navigates into the directory you want to go into.
```bash
cd directoryname/
```

`cd ..` navigates up or back one directory.
```bash
cd ..
```


These additional commands are useful for creating and removing directories and files:

`mkdir` "make directory" creates a new directory in the directory you are currently in.
```bash
mkdir directoryname/
```

`cp` is followed by the name of the file to copy and then the directory you want it copied into.
```bash
cp filename.filetype path/to/directory
```

`rm` removes or deletes files.
```bash
rm filename.filetype
```
