Here is a summary of the basic commands you can use to navigate the command line:

```bash
ls
```
`ls` lists directory contents

```bash
pwd
```
`pwd` "print working directory" tells you what directory you are currently in.

```bash
cd directoryname/
```
`cd` "change directory" navigates into the directory you want to go into.

```bash
cd ..
```
`cd ..` navigates up or back one directory.


These additional commands are useful for creating and removing directories and files:

```bash
mkdir directoryname/
```
`mkdir` "make directory" creates a new directory in the directory you are currently in.

```bash
cp filename.filetype path/to/directory
```
`cp` is followed by the name of the file to copy and then the directory you want it copied into.

```bash
rm filename.filetype
```
`rm` removes or deletes files.
