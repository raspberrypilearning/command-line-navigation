### Essential commands
Here is a summary of basic commands for navigating the command line:

* `ls` lists the contents of the folder (directory) you're currently in:
```bash
ls
```

* `pwd` stands for 'print working directory' and tells you what directory you are currently in:
```bash
pwd
```

* `cd` stands for 'change directory' and navigates to the directory you want to move into:
```bash
cd directoryname/
```

* `cd ..` navigates up one directory, meaning it moves you from a subfolder into its parent folder:
```bash
cd ..
```

### Additional commands
These are useful for creating and removing directories and files.

* `mkdir` stands for 'make directory' and creates a new directory in the directory you are currently in:
```bash
mkdir directoryname/
```

* `cp` is followed by the name of the file to copy and then the directory you want it copied into:
```bash
cp filename.filetype path/to/directory
```

* `rm` stands for 'remove' and deletes files (careful with this one, you cannot undo it):
```bash
rm filename.filetype
```
